Project 1

Why are teachers leaving the classroom? 

Colab link:  https://github.com/jproctor-rebecca/lambdaprojects/blob/master/WhyAreTeachersLeavingClassrooms_RJProctor.ipynb

Source data (zip file): https://github.com/jproctor-rebecca/lambdaprojects/blob/master/Teacher_Core_School_Consolidated_TN.zip

National media reports of teachers leaving the classroom in mass. The question is why? What are the key issues that make teachers feel it is impossible to remain in the classroom? In a sampling of public data, we will look at this issue and draw comparisons to the national issue.

Project 2

Are Teacher Responses Correlated to the Type of School In Which They Work?

Juypter notebook link:  https://github.com/jproctor-rebecca/lambdaprojects/blob/master/Are_Teacher_Responses_Correlated_to_the%20_Type_of_School_In_Which_They_Work_RJProctor.ipynb

Source data:  https://github.com/jproctor-rebecca/lambdaprojects/blob/master/teach_geo_merged.csv

In the continued exploration of the question of why teachers are leaving classrooms, we examine using machine learning models whether one environmental factor is highly coorelated to educator feelings about their work environments.

Using historical booking data from AirBnB, AirBnB Optimal Price will allow a user to predict the trends for optimal pricing for their properties based on variables such as location, time of year and other considerations. The user will be able to manage multiple properties at different locations and be able to make adjustments to their expectations for booking, as well as what they should be charging.

**The Business Problem**

**Too many choices can overwhelm users.  If offered too many options, the user may not buy anything.  Streaming services like Spotify have massive catalogs.  Identifying the tracks a user might like and recommending the product they might like is crucicial for their business.**

**To solve this business problem we are going to create two playlists, a Popular Playlist which is then used to identify songs that are similar to a song a user already likes, giving the user a personalized playlist, or recommendations.**
